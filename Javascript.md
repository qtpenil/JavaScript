1️⃣ JavaScript Basics (Foundation)

These look simple but behave very differently from Java.
Must know:

let, const, var (scope differences)  ✅
Data types (primitive vs reference)  ✅
Type coercion (== vs ===)   ✅
Truthy / Falsy values   ✅
Template literals   ✅
Destructuring (objects & arrays)  ✅
Spread (...) & Rest operators  ✅

🔑 Why important
JS is loosely typed
Many bugs come from coercion & scope


2️⃣ Functions (Very Important)

JS treats functions as first-class citizens.
Topics:

Function declaration vs expression  ✅
Arrow functions   ✅
Default parameters   ✅
Higher-order functions ✅
Callback functions   ✅

🔑 Used everywhere in:

Event handling
Async code
React components

3️⃣ Scope, Closure & Hoisting ⭐⭐⭐

This is INTERVIEW GOLD.
Concepts:

Global / Function / Block scope  ✅
Lexical scope   ✅
Closures   ✅
Hoisting behavior   ✅

🔑 Why important:

Memory management
React hooks
Async behavior


4️⃣ Objects & Prototypes (JS “OOP”)

JS OOP ≠ Java OOP.
Learn:

Object creation    ✅
this keyword   ✅ (confusing)
Prototypes
Prototype chain
call, apply, bind
Classes (ES6 syntax sugar)

🔑 Why important:

Framework internals
Understanding how JS really works


5️⃣ Arrays & Functional Programming

JS uses functional style heavily.
Must know:

map, filter, reduce
find, some, every
Immutability concepts

🔑 Why important:

State management in React
Cleaner logic

6️⃣ Asynchronous JavaScript ⭐⭐⭐ (MOST IMPORTANT)

This is where JS shines and confuses people.
Concepts:

Event loop
Call stack
Microtasks vs macrotasks
setTimeout
Promises
async / await
Error handling in async

🔑 Why important:

API calls
UI responsiveness
React data fetching

7️⃣ JavaScript Runtime & Browser APIs

JS is not just the language.
Learn:

DOM manipulation
Events & event bubbling
fetch API
LocalStorage / SessionStorage
Cookies
CORS basics

🔑 Why important:

Frontend behavior
API communication with backend


8️⃣ ES6+ Features (Modern JS)

React assumes you know these.
Must know:

Modules (import/export)
Optional chaining (?.)
Nullish coalescing (??)
Dynamic keys
Object shorthand


9️⃣ Error Handling & Debugging

try/catch
Custom errors
Debugging in browser dev tools
Stack traces

🔑 Helps in:

Production debugging
API failure handling
